            My name is Cuong Le. I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, 
             to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like
              to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music 
              flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. 
              <br>
              <br>
              I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring,
               rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be
                alone, I like to be surrounded by people.
